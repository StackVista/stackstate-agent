# StackState Agent

Contains the code for the StackState agent V2. Agent integrations are not included in this project and can be found [here](https://github.com/StackVista/stackstate-agent-integrations).

## Installation

Installation instructions are available on the [StackState docs site](https://docs.stackstate.com/stackpacks/integrations/agent).

## Getting development started

To build the Agent you need:
 * [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 or later. You'll also need to set your `$GOPATH` and have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path.
 * Python 3.7+ along with development libraries for tooling. You will also need Python 2.7 if you are building the Agent with Python 2 support.
 * Python dependencies. You may install these with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   This will also pull in [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org) if not yet installed.
 * CMake version 3.12 or later and a C++ compiler

**Note:** you may want to use a python virtual environment to avoid polluting your
      system-wide python environment with the agent build/dev dependencies. You can
      create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` and then use the `invoke agent.build`
      parameters `--python-home-2=<venv_path>` and/or `--python-home-3=<venv_path>`
      (depending on the python versions you are using) to use the virtual environment's
      interpreter and libraries. By default, this environment is only used for dev dependencies
      listed in `requirements.txt`.

**Note:** You may have previously installed `invoke` via brew on MacOS, or `pip` in
      any other platform. We recommend you use the version pinned in the requirements
      file for a smooth development/build experience.

Builds and tests are orchestrated with `invoke`, type `invoke --list` on a shell
to see the available tasks.

To start working on the Agent, you can build the `master` branch:

1. Checkout the repo: `git clone https://github.com/StackVista/stackstate-agent.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent`.
2. cd into the project folder: `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/StackVista/stackstate-agent`.
3. Install go tools: `invoke install-tools`.
4. Install go dependencies: `invoke deps`.
   Make sure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH` otherwise this step might fail.
5. Create a development `datadog.yaml` configuration file in `dev/dist/datadog.yaml`, containing a valid API key: `api_key: <API_KEY>`
6. Build the agent with `invoke agent.build --build-exclude=systemd`.

    By default, the Agent will be built to use Python 3 but you can select which Python version you want to use:

      - `invoke agent.build --python-runtimes 2` for Python2 only
      - `invoke agent.build --python-runtimes 3` for Python3 only
      - `invoke agent.build --python-runtimes 2,3` for both Python2 and Python3

     You can specify a custom Python location for the agent (useful when using
     virtualenvs):

       invoke agent.build \
         --python-runtimes 2,3 \
         --python-home-2=$GOPATH/src/github.com/StackVista/stackstate-agent/venv2 \
         --python-home-3=$GOPATH/src/github.com/StackVista/stackstate-agent/venv3 .

    Running `invoke agent.build`:

     * Discards any changes done in `bin/agent/dist`.
     * Builds the Agent and writes the binary to `bin/agent/agent`.
     * Copies files from `dev/dist` to `bin/agent/dist`. See `https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/main/dev/dist/README.md` for more information.

     If you built an older version of the agent, you may have the error `make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`. To solve the issue, you should remove `CMakeCache.txt` from `rtloader` folder with `rm rtloader/CMakeCache.txt`.

## Testing

Run tests using `invoke test`. During development, add the `--skip-linters` option to skip straight to the tests.
```
invoke test --targets=./pkg/aggregator/... --skip-linters
```

When testing code that depends on [rtloader](/rtloader), build and install it first.
```
invoke rtloader.make && invoke rtloader.install
invoke test --targets=./pkg/collector/python --skip-linters
```

## Run

You can run the agent with:
```
./bin/agent/agent run -c bin/agent/dist/stackstate.yaml
```

The file `bin/agent/dist/datadog.yaml` is copied from `dev/dist/datadog.yaml` by `invoke agent.build` and must contain a valid api key.

## Install

### Linux

##### Official

To install the official release:

    $ curl -o- https://stackstate-agent-3.s3.amazonaws.com/install.sh | STS_API_KEY="xxx" STS_URL="yyy" bash
     or
    $ wget -qO- https://stackstate-agent-3.s3.amazonaws.com/install.sh | STS_API_KEY="xxx" STS_URL="yyy" bash

##### Test

If you want to install a branch version use the test repository:

    $ curl -o- https://stackstate-agent-3-test.s3.amazonaws.com/install.sh | STS_API_KEY="xxx" STS_URL="yyy" CODE_NAME="PR_NAME" bash
     or
    $ wget -qO- https://stackstate-agent-3-test.s3.amazonaws.com/install.sh | STS_API_KEY="xxx" STS_URL="yyy" CODE_NAME="PR_NAME" bash

and replace `PR_NAME` with the branch name (e.g. `master`, `STAC-xxxx`).

### Docker

##### Official

    $ docker pull artifactory.tooling.stackstate.io/docker-virtual/stackstate/stackstate-agent-2:latest

##### Test

    $ docker pull artifactory.tooling.stackstate.io/docker-virtual/stackstate/stackstate-agent-2-test:latest

### Windows

##### Official

To install the official release:

    $ . { iwr -useb https://stackstate-agent-3.s3.amazonaws.com/install.ps1 } | iex; install -stsApiKey "xxx" -stsUrl "yyy"

##### Test

If you want to install a branch version use the test repository:

    $ . { iwr -useb https://stackstate-agent-3-test.s3.amazonaws.com/install.ps1 } | iex; install -stsApiKey "xxx" -stsUrl "yyy" -codeName "PR_NAME"

and replace `PR_NAME` with the branch name (e.g. `master`, `STAC-xxxx`).

#### Arguments

Other arguments can be passed to the installation command.

Linux arguments:

- `STS_HOSTNAME` = Instance hostname
- `$HOST_TAGS` = Agent host tags to use for all topology component (by default `os:linux` will be added)
- `SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION` = Skip ssl certificates validation when talking to the backend (defaults to `false`)
- `STS_INSTALL_ONLY` = Agent won't be automatically started after installation

Windows arguments:

- `hostname` = Instance hostname
- `tags` = Agent host tags to use for all topology component (by default `os:windows` will be added)
- `skipSSLValidation` = Skip ssl certificates validation when talking to the backend (defaults to `false`)
- `agentVersion` = Version of the Agent to be installed (defaults to `latest`)

##### Omnibus notes for windows build process

We ended up checking in a patched gem file under omnibus/vendor/cache/libyajl2-1.2.1.gem, to make windows builds work with newer msys toolchain.
The source of this can be found here https://github.com/StackVista/libyajl2-gem/tree/1.2.0-fixed-lssp. Ideally we'd be able to drop this hack once we
bump the ruby version > 2.6.5 because libyajl2 compiles proper on those ruby versions.

## GitLab cluster agent pipeline

If you want to speed up the GitLab pipeline and run only the steps related to the cluster agent, include the string `[cluster-agent]` in your commit message.

## Testing cluster-agent helm chart

The acceptance tests in our pipeline use the stackstate-agent helm chart to install the agent in a test cluster. If you make changes to the stackstate-agent helm chart, you probably want to test if our acceptance tests will work after your changes.

When you open a merge request on the helm-chart repository, a test version of that chart will be published to a test helm repository [stackstate-test](https://helm-test.stackstate.io). You can add that test repo in your machine by running the following commands:

```shell
helm repo add stackstate-test https://helm-test.stackstate.io && helm repo update
```

You can then install this version of the cluster-agent helm chart by running:

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --set-string 'stackstate.apiKey'='<api-key>' \
  --set-string 'stackstate.cluster.name'='<cluster-name' \
  --set-string 'stackstate.url'='<stackstate-url>' \
  stackstate-agent stackstate-test/stackstate-agent --version <version>
```

`<version>` is the new version you've set on `helm-charts/stable/stackstate-agent/Chart.yaml` on your feature branch.

To use this version in the `stackstate-agent` pipeline, create a branch and update the `AGENT_HELM_CHART_VERSION` variable on `.gitlab-ci-agent.yml`, with that the pipeline will use the test helm repository that was updated by the helm-charts pipeline.
