# **Black-box testing framework**

---

# Black-box API testing

Examines functionalities without poking into the product, instead verification happens using APIs.

Testers know what the software is supposed to do but is not aware of how it does it.

# Goal: end to end verification

What is needed to verify that an integration works

- check
- stackpack

---

# Goal: end to end verification (2)

What is needed to verify that an integration works

- check
- stackpack

## tests characteristics

- independent
- isolated
- reproducible

---

# Requirements

- **simplicity**
  - same experience like you would run unit tests
  - bootstrap integration use cases without prior knowledge
- **reusability**
  - different variations in SUT
  - explore how integration works in certain condition not automated yet

# Anatomy of a test scenario

**SUT**:
```
  Infrastructure

   Application
```

# Anatomy of a test scenario (2)

**SUT**:
```
  Infrastructure      Infrastructure   ...
        ↑                   ↑
   Application         Application     ...

# How Beest does it

OS tools:
- Hive - Terraform module
- Bee - Ansible roles
- Expectation - Pytest
- CLI - Cobra
- some Go glue code

- Hive: eks, vpc, security groups
- Hive: vm, vpc, security groups
- Bee: receiver
- Bee: node/cluster agent, kubemetrics, sample workload
